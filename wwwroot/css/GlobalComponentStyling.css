/*
    So thoughts on how to implement the CSS global feature
    I mainly think it should have the colour scheme, padding, font size, font colour, any hover effects, etc. included.
    Somethings that I can think of mainly is :
        button, 
        the text styling (font, weight, size)        
*/
/* 
    Scrollbar background - grey
    The green colour is generalized to an action event... We are using the colour for everything instead!!!!
    Burger menu isn't pointer cursor
    Each element / component that is being re-used need to have the same style...

/*    
    input[type = "button"], input[type = "submit"] {
    background-color: rgba(0, 188, 174,1);
    color: white;
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 1em;
    font-weight: 600;
    font-family: opensans-condensed-bold;
    border-radius: 1em;
    border: none;
    }

    input[type = "button"], input[type = "submit"]:hover {
